# AoC-2018-python-solutions
python solutions for Advent of Code 2018
note:
most files are of the following form:
\d+.py - part 1 solution (normal)
\d+\^2 - part 2 solution (normal)
however, the following files are different:
.*plot.py - a plot of the problem.
.*explained.py - an explanation of how the inefficient (normal) solution works.
.*efficient.py - an efficient alternative to the normal solution.
stencil.py - a stencil I've used to start each day.
